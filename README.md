Tough days are gone. I feel that my life is entering a new phase.

I solved one significant problem of mine -- over-empathizing. I am finally normal.

All those misery memories are fading away.

I did really well this year. Instead of escaping, I face the reality. It is really brave for me to achieve that.

Misery is inevitable, but I manage to overcome it, with great efforts. I think it through, I make a path of my own. I change my own destiny. I earn my own happiness.

I deserve it. I deserve to be happy.

After all, I am a really nice lady with generosity, kindness, bravery, and wits.

I love myself, and I love my life.
